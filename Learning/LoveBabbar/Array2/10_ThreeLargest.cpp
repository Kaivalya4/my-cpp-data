/*
Given	an	array	with	all	distinct	elements,	find	the	largest	three	elements.
Expected	time	complexity	is	O(n)	and	extra	space	is	O(1).

->1 If it is not O(n) then we can have used sort(O(nlogn)) and found out last three elements
->2 Find first Largest , second largest , third largest element one by one.
->3 Algorithm - Suppose we find another second largest then previous 2nd largest will become third largest. This algo works that way-
1) Initialize the largest three elements as minus infinite.
    first = second = third = -âˆž

2) Iterate through all elements of array.
   a) Let current array element be x.
   b) If (x > first)
      {
          // This order of assignment is important
          third = second
          second = first
          first = x
       }
   c)  Else if (x > second)
      {
          third = second
          second = x
      }
   d)  Else if (x > third)
      {
          third = x
      }

3) Print first, second and third.
